# 🚀 RLHF Implementation
This repository contains an implementation of <b>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</b>. It features a modular setup that includes both a <b>reward model</b> and a <b>policy model</b> used for alignment 🤖📈.

The process involves training a reward model to evaluate outputs based on human or proxy preferences, and then optimizing a language model using this reward signal through reinforcement learning. This approach enables the model to generate responses that align more closely with human expectations and desired behaviors.

### 🔧Key components:

- <b>🏅Reward Model</b>: Trained to distinguish between preferred and less preferred responses.

- <b>🧠Policy Model</b>: Fine-tuned using reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO) to maximize the reward model's score.

This implementation serves as a foundation for experiments and further research into scalable alignment methods and preference modeling for large language models. 📚🧪
